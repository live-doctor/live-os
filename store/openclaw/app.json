  "overview": "Clears your inbox, sends emails, manages your calendar, checks you in for flights. All from WhatsApp, Telegram, or any chat app you already use.\n\nThe OpenClaw app on umbrelOS provides a seamless setup experience. Just enter your API key and go. A headless browser is configured out of the box so your new AI assistant can immediately interact with the entire internet.\n\nOpenClaw is running inside the umbrelOS app sandbox. It has complete freedom to install software inside its own environment while all your existing apps and data remain securely protected.\n\nOpenClaw is also running behind the umbrelOS app proxy, so only you can securely access your OpenClaw instance.\n\n## What It Does\n  - **Runs Locally** - Anthropic, OpenAI, or local models. Private by default—your data stays yours. On your Umbrel.\n  - **Any Chat App** - Talk to it on WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, or iMessage. Works in DMs and group chats.\n  - **Persistent Memory** - Remembers you and becomes uniquely yours. Your preferences, your context, your AI.\n  - **Browser Control** - It can browse the web, fill forms, and extract data from any site.\n  - **Sandboxed System Access** - Read and write files, run shell commands, execute scripts within its own sandbox. Your existing data and apps are fully protected.\n  - **Skills & Plugins** - Extend with community skills or build your own. It can even write its own.",
